## IF STATEMENT in Python

### Example 1: Basic `if` statement

```python
x = 10
if x > 5:  # Condition is true, so the block runs
    print("x is greater than 5")

```

### Example 2: Condition is false

```python
y = 3
if y > 5:  # Condition is false, so no code runs
    print("y is greater than 5")  # This will not be printed

```

### Example 3: Nested `if` statement

```python
z = 10
if z > 5:
    if z < 15:  # This condition is also checked inside the first if
        print("z is between 5 and 15")

```
