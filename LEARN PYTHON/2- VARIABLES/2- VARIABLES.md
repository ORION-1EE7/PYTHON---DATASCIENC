# 2- VARIABLES

**VARIABLES:** Variables are used to store data in memory. The data stored in a variable can be changed during the program execution.
**=> STEPS TO DECLARE A VARIABLE:**

1. **Data type:** `int`, `float`, `double`, `char`, `void`.
2. **Variable name:** Any name you want to give to the variable.
3. **Value:** The value you want to store in the variable.
**DECLARATION:** A statement that reserves memory for a variable.
**Statement:** A line of code that performs a specific task, ending with a semicolon.
**EXAMPLE:**

```python
age = 10
height = 5.5
name = 'A'

```

### Python Code for Variable Declaration and Updates:

```python
# Declare a variable and assign a value during declaration
age = 10
print("age is:", age)
height = 5.5
print("height is:", height)
# Declare a variable and assign a value after declaration
name = ''
name = 'A'
print("name is:", name)
# Update a variable's value
age2 = 20
print("age2 is:", age2)
age2 = 30  # Updating the value of age2
print("age2 updated is:", age2)

```
